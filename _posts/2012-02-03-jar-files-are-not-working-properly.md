Problem - Jar (.jar) files are not working as it should be they are opening in _Nokia Pc Suite_ or in other program.

Solution â€“ Easiest way to solve this problem

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall the program in which they are opening.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now change the open with setting of .jar file 

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set it to _Java(TM) SE Platform._

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Always open in this program

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now again install the program

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time jar files will work properly.
