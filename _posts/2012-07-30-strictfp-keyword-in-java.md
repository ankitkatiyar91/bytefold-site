 In java &nbsp;_strictfp &nbsp;_&nbsp;is used to strict all the calculations of &nbsp;to strictly follow the strict floating point calculations in all platforms.

&nbsp;

It can be used with class , interfaces and non-abstract methods. If used with the method then it ensures all the calculations inside that method must follow floating point math. When used with the class then it ensures all calculations inside that class must follow floating point math.

Compile-time constant expressions must always use strict floating-point behavior

It providestotal platform-independency and &nbsp;take advantage of the speed and precision of the extended precision floating-point operations supported by x86 CPUs&nbsp;
