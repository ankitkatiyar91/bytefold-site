Convert Date from one timezone to another without hassle. Covert a different format to different format.

**Features:-**  
1. Easy to use.  
2. Free of cost.  
3. Lightweight.  
4. Pure Java tool.

If you want to calculate your age or want to know how much younger or older your friend than you, Have a date in a different timezone and want to know the time in your timezone or what time in different timezone now. All this is just one download and one click away. Maybe you don't have internet next time just download it once and use it. Any platform and place just you need Java enabled (Today most of the systems have Java).
